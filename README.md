# drugTargetsDiscoveryCourse
## Training course on using systematically OT datasets to answer drug targets discovery problems. 
### Advanced Bioinformatics module of the Cambridge Genomic Medicine Programme (2024)

Partical exercise using Google Colab notebook to work with Open Target datasets (Target parquet file) to adress questions related to drug targets discovery such as Tractability, Safety and Progressibility. 

This lesson was given in the fifth day of the course Advanced Bioinformatics module of the Cambridge Genomic Medicine Programme (2024). It aimed to show students how to use Google Colab and PySpark to manage and access Open Targets datasources to answer drug discovery questions on a systematic way. 

You will learn: 

> Install and set up Spark session on Google colab.

> Download parquet files from Open Targets download page

> Synchronise Google Colab with your Google Drive and upload your local files to the notebook.

> Simple Pyspark operations on dataframes

> Introduction to 3 aspects to consider on drug targets prioritisation for drug discovery: Tractability, Safety and Progressibility
